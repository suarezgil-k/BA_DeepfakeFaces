"""
NOTE:
This file is a modified copy of the original source  file: clip.py
The original file remains unchanged.
This version was created for debugging and adaptation within the scope of the bachelor thesis.
Edited lines of code are labeled #EDITED

Specific change:
- Fixed variable reference in compute_embeddings_batched (image_keys → image_paths)
- Corrected batch indexing (image_paths[i] → image_paths[x] within loop)
